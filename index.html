<p>Hygroscope is a Thor-based command-line tool for managing the launch of complex CloudFormation stacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> is a great way to manage infrastructure resources using code, but it has some aspects that make it a pain:</p>

<ol>
<li>Templates must be written in JSON, which, in addition to being difficult for a human to read, does not support niceties such as inline comments and repeated blocks.</li>
<li>Launching CloudFormation stacks requires knowledge of the various parameters that need to be provided, and it is difficult to repeatably launch a stack since parameters are not saved in any convenient way.</li>
<li>There is no easy mechanism to send a payload of data to an instance during stack creation (for instance scripts and recipes to bootstrap an instance).</li>
<li>Finally, it is difficult to launch stacks that build upon already-existing stacks (i.e. an application stack within an existing VPC stack) because one must manually provide a variety of identifiers (subnets, IP addresses, security groups).</li>
</ol>

<p>Hygroscope aims to solve each of these specific problems in an opinionated way:</p>

<ol>
<li>CF templates are written in YAML and processed using <a href="https://github.com/drrb/cfoo">cfoo</a>, which provides a variety of convenience methods that increase readability.</li>
<li>Hygroscope can interactively prompt for each parameter and save inputted parameters to a file called a paramset. Additional stack launches can make use of existing paramsets, or can use paramsets as the basis and prompt for updated parameters.</li>
<li>A payload directory, if present, will be packaged and uploaded to S3. Hygroscope will generate and pass to CF a signed time-limited URL for accessing and downloading the payload, or the CloudFormation template can manage an instance profile granting indefinite access to the payload.</li>
<li>If an existing stack is specified, its outputs will be fetched and passed through as input parameters when launching a new stack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hygroscope is currently under development but mostly functional. Run <code>hygroscope help</code> to view inline command documentation and options.  See <a href="https://github.com/agperson/hygroscope/wiki/Structure-of-a-Hygroscopic-Template">template structure</a> for information about the format of hygroscopic templates.</p>
